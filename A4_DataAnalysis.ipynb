    "    - This means passing all the tests you can see in the notebook here does not guarantee you have the right answer!\n",
    "    - In particular many of the tests you can see simply check that the right variable names exist. Hidden tests check the actual values. \n",
    "        - It is up to you to check the values, and make sure they seem reasonable.\n",
    "- A reminder to restart the kernel and re-run the code as a first line check if things seem to go weird.\n",
    "    - For example, note that some cells can only be run once, because they re-write a variable (for example, your dataframe), and change it in a way that means a second execution will fail. \n",

    "Beyond just plotting the data, we should check some other basic properties of the data. This serves both as a way to get a 'feel' for the data, and to look for any quirks or oddities about the data, that may indicate issues that need resolving. To do this, let's explore that data a bit (not limiting ourselves to only features that we plan to use - exploring the dataset as a whole can help us find any issues). \n",

    "- You answers should NOT be pandas objects (Series or DataFrames), extract answers so the variables are ints, floats or strings (as appropriate).\n",
